# Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization

As a coursera certified specialization completer you will have a proven deep understanding on massive parallel  data processing, data exploration and visualization, and advanced  machine learning & deep learning. You'll understand the  mathematical foundations behind all machine learning & deep learning  algorithms. You can apply knowledge in practical use cases, justify  architectural decisions, understand the characteristics of  different algorithms, frameworks & technologies & how they  impact model performance & scalability.


If you choose to take this specialization and earn the Coursera specialization certificate, you will also earn an IBM digital badge.  To find out more about IBM digital badges follow the link ibm.biz/badging.

Applied Learning Project

Learners will build fully scalable end to end data integration, machine learning and deep learning pipelines using the most prominent and widely used frameworks and technologies like Apache Spark, scikit-learn, SparkML, SystemML, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, DeepLearning4J, Apache CouchDB and MQTT.

### 1. Scalable Data Science with Apache Spark
After completing this course, you will be able to:
•	Describe how basic statistical measures, are used to reveal  patterns within the data 
•	Recognize data characteristics, patterns, trends, deviations or inconsistencies, and potential outliers.
•	Identify useful techniques for working with big data such as dimension reduction and feature selection methods 
•	Use advanced tools and charting libraries to:
      o	improve efficiency of analysis of big-data with partitioning and parallel analysis 
      o	Visualize the data in an number of 2D and 3D formats (Box Plot, Run Chart, Scatter Plot, Pareto Chart, and Multidimensional Scaling)

### 2. Advanced MAchine Learning and Signal Processing 
Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing, is part of the IBM Advanced Data Science Specialization which IBM is currently creating and gives you easy access to the invaluable insights into Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Models used by experts in many field relevant disciplines. We’ll learn about the fundamentals of Linear Algebra to understand how machine learning modes work. Then we introduce the most popular Machine Learning Frameworks for python Scikit-Learn and SparkML. SparkML is making up the greatest portion of this course since scalability is key to address performance bottlenecks. We learn how to tune the models in parallel by evaluating hundreds of different parameter-combinations in parallel. We’ll continuously use a real-life example from IoT (Internet of Things), for exemplifying the different algorithms. For passing the course you are even required to create your own vibration sensor data using the accelerometer sensors in your smartphone. So you are actually working on a self-created, real dataset throughout the course.

### 3. Applied AI and Deep learning
 Applied Artificial Intelligence with DeepLearning, is part of the IBM Advanced Data Science Certificate which IBM is currently creating and gives you easy access to the invaluable insights into Deep Learning models used by experts in Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, Time Series Analysis, and many other disciplines. We’ll learn about the fundamentals of Linear Algebra and Neural Networks. Then we introduce the most popular DeepLearning Frameworks like Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, DeepLearning4J and Apache SystemML. Keras and TensorFlow are making up the greatest portion of this course. We learn about Anomaly Detection, Time Series Forecasting, Image Recognition and Natural Language Processing by building up models using Keras on real-life examples from IoT (Internet of Things), Financial Marked Data, Literature or Image Databases. Finally, we learn how to scale those artificial brains using Kubernetes, Apache Spark and GPUs.


### 4. Advanced Data Science Capstone
This project completer has proven a deep understanding on massive parallel data processing, data exploration and visualization, advanced machine learning and deep learning and how to apply his knowledge in a real-world practical use case where he justifies architectural decisions, proves understanding the characteristics of different algorithms, frameworks and technologies and how they impact model performance and scalability.
